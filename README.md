# personal-dashboard

This piece of software is collecting data about me all the time and aggregating them.
You can [read about it more on my blog](http://ahmetalpbalkan.com/blog/personal-dashboard/)
and see a demo on [my home page](https://ahmetalpbalkan.com/):

Currently collected metrics:

- `github` contribution activities
- `wakatime` coding time
- `lastfm` listened tracks
- `jawboneup` steps, sleeps, resting heartrate
- `foursquare` checkins
- `twitter` followers, tweets

I am hoping to add instructions on how to get it up and running for yourself
when I have free time.
